I want to stuff you up my kawaii ass!-Woody grabbed a bunch of flavored lube and rubbed it all over his head.-Woody: Oh my! Its cherry flavored lube! Cherry is my favorite!-Woody then stuffed his head up into Andys tight ass!-The other toys around the room watched intently as Woody shoved his head back and forth into Andys nice ass, continuously making a squishy wet noise.-The other toys also became aroused and they all gathered around Woody and Andy and started to urinate all over them, and then they started to masturbate.-Andy: Oh my goodness, Woody Chan! You are churning my insides up so well! Your nose is stimulating my prostate! OH YES!-All the other toys became so aroused by this, that they could not help themselves anymore!-They pushed Woody completely inside, and they all went inside.-All of them wanted to be inside Andys nice round ass.-Andy: No wait guys! My ass cannot hold this much! Im getting so full!-All the toys went inside of poor squirming Andy and pretty much, he was beyond full, and died from having his insides completely damaged.-The mother came inside and found Andy, dead with a huge ass hemorrhage on his anus, with a HUGE belly full of toys.";
